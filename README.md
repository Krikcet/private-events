# Private Events

This is my submission for the [Private Events](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events) project as assigned by The Odin Project.

## Assignment
>You want to build a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.com) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.
>
>A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).
>
>This project will require you to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names (hint: you won’t be able to just rely on Rails’ defaults like you have before).

## Notes

This was my biggest rails undertaking thus far. I used JS to dynamically render the invitation form on the event page.
# To Do
- make each event private and add the functionality for the event creator to invite specific users to an event
  - delete unnecessary views

- back to event should link back to current event from edit event page

- make it purdy
  - use bootstrap grid to style events index
    - try to place gap between event cards
